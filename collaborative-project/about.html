        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <div class="story-content">
          <p>
            We started this journey as complete beginners, curious about how websites are built
            and excited to learn something new together. What began as casual interest has grown
            into a passionate pursuit of web development skills.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            By working on separate pages of the same website, we're learning both individual
            development skills and collaborative teamwork. Each page reflects our unique
            interests and growing abilities while maintaining a cohesive overall design.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This collaborative approach has taught us the importance of communication,
            planning, and supporting each other through challenges and breakthroughs.
