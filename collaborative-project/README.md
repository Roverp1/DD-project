# Multi-Page Learning Project

Build a website together with separate pages for each person!

## Collaboration Approach
**Each person works on their own page** - no conflicts!

1. **Person A**: Builds `person-a-page.html` + `person-a-styles.css`
2. **Person B**: Builds `person-b-page.html` + `person-b-styles.css`  
3. **Together**: Work on shared pages (`index.html`, `about.html`)

## Project Structure
```
collaborative-project/
├── index.html           # Homepage (work together)
├── about.html           # About page (work together)
├── person-a-page.html   # Person A's individual page
├── person-b-page.html   # Person B's individual page
├── styles.css           # Shared styles
├── person-a-styles.css  # Person A's styles
└── person-b-styles.css  # Person B's styles
```

## Learning Goals
- **Person A Focus**: Portfolio-style page (skills, projects, contact)
- **Person B Focus**: Creative showcase page (artwork, services, contact)
- **Shared Work**: Navigation, homepage content, about page

## Collaboration Rules
1. **Work on different files** - avoid conflicts
2. **Daily check-ins**: "What are you working on today?"
3. **Simple git workflow**: Create branches for your changes
4. **Test frequently**: Open pages in browser to see progress

## Getting Started
1. Look at `../example/index.html` in browser for inspiration
2. Start with your individual page using basic HTML structure
3. Use the cheatsheet (`../html-css-cheatsheet.md`) for help
4. Ask questions when stuck!

## Tips for Success
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Look at example website for design ideas (don't copy code)
- Use the cheatsheet when you need HTML/CSS help  
- Test in browser after every few changes
- Help each other when stuck!
